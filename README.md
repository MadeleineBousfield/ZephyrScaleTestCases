# ZephyrScale Test Cases

This project was completed as part of a [Udemy course: The Complete 2024 Software Testing Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/testerbootcamp/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOWPP). 
<br><br>The purpose of this project was to practice writing test cases while becoming familiar with using ZephyrScale inside Jira. Test cases were written for the sign up and sign in functionalities of Uber. These test cases were also used to create smoke and regression test cycles, execute a smoke test and generate a test report.
